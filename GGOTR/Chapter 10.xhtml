         <p class="cotx">Frodo, Pippin, and Sam made their way back to the parlour. There was no light. Merry
            was not there, and the fire had burned
            low. It was not until they had puffed up the embers into a blaze and thrown on a couple
            of faggots that they discovered Strider
            had come with them. There she was calmly sitting in a chair by the door!
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Hallo!’ said Pippin. ‘Who are you, and what do you want?’</p>
         
         <p>‘I am called Strider,’ she answered; ‘and though she may have forgotten it, your friend
            promised to have a quiet talk with me.’</p>
         
         <p>‘You said I might hear something to my advantage, I believe,’ said Frodo. ‘What have
            you to say?’</p>
         
         <p>‘Several things,’ answered Strider. ‘But, of course, I have my price.’</p>
         
         <p>‘What do you mean?’ asked Frodo sharply.</p>
         
         <p>‘Don’t be alarmed! I mean just this: I will tell you what I know, and give you some
            good advice – but I shall want a reward.’</p>
         
         <p>‘And what will that be, pray?’ said Frodo. She suspected now that she had fallen in
            with a rascal, and she thought uncomfortably
            that she had brought only a little money with her. All of it would hardly satisfy
            a rogue, and she could not spare any of it.
            </p>
         
         <p>‘No more than you can afford,’ answered Strider with a slow smile, as if she guessed
            Frodo’s thoughts. ‘Just this: you must
            take me along with you, until I wish to leave you.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Oh, indeed!’ replied Frodo, surprised, but not much relieved. ‘Even if I wanted another
            companion, I should not agree to
            any such thing, until I knew a good deal more about you, and your business.’
            </p>
         <a id="page214"></a>
         
         <p>‘Excellent!’ exclaimed Strider, crossing her legs and sitting back comfortably. ‘You
            seem to be coming to your senses again,
            and that is all to the good. You have been much too careless so far. Very well! I
            will tell you what I know, and leave the
            reward to you. You may be glad to grant it, when you have heard me.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Go on then!’ said Frodo. ‘What do you know?’</p>
         
         <p>‘Too much; too many dark things,’ said Strider grimly. ‘But as for your business——’
            She got up and went to the door, opened
            it quickly and looked out. Then she shut it quietly and sat down again. ‘I have quick
            ears,’ she went on, lowering her voice,
            ‘and though I cannot disappear, I have hunted many wild and wary things and I can
            usually avoid being seen, if I wish. Now,
            I was behind the hedge this evening on the Road west of Bree, when four hobbits came
            out of the Downlands. I need not repeat
            all that they said to old Bombadil or to one another; but one thing interested me.
            <em>Please remember</em>, said one of them, <em>that the name Baggins must not be mentioned. I am Ms. Underhill, if any name must
               be given.</em> That interested me so much that I followed them here. I slipped over the gate just
            behind them. Maybe Ms. Baggins has an
            honest reason for leaving her name behind; but if so, I should advise her and her
            friends to be more careful.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘I don’t see what interest my name has for anyone in Bree,’ said Frodo angrily, ‘and
            I have still to learn why it interests
            you. Ms. Strider may have an honest reason for spying and eavesdropping; but if so,
            I should advise her to explain it.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Well answered!’ said Strider laughing. ‘But the explanation is simple: I was looking
            for a Hobbit called Frodo Baggins. I
            wanted to find her quickly. I had learned that she was carrying out of the Shire,
            well, a secret that concerned me and my friends.
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Now, don’t mistake me!’ she cried, as Frodo rose from her seat, and Sam jumped up
            with a scowl. ‘I shall take more care of
            the secret than you do. And care is needed!’ She leaned forward and looked at them.
            ‘Watch every shadow!’ she said in a low
            voice. ‘Black horsemen have passed through Bree.
            </p>
         <a id="page215"></a>
         
         <p>On Monday one came down the Greenway, they say; and another appeared later, coming
            up the Greenway from the south.’</p>
         
         <p class="spb">There was a silence. At last Frodo spoke to Pippin and Sam: ‘I ought to have guessed
            it from the way the gatekeeper greeted
            us,’ she said. ‘And the landlord seems to have heard something. Why did she press
            us to join the company? And why on earth did
            we behave so foolishly: we ought to have stayed quiet in here.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘It would have been better,’ said Strider. ‘I would have stopped your going into the
            common-room, if I could; but the innkeeper
            would not let me in to see you, or take a message.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Do you think he——’ began Frodo.</p>
         
         <p>‘No, I don’t think any harm of old Butterbur. Only she does not altogether like mysterious
            vagabonds of my sort.’ Frodo gave
            her a puzzled look. ‘Well, I have rather a rascally look, have I not?’ said Strider
            with a curl of her lip and a queer gleam
            in her eye. ‘But I hope we shall get to know one another better. When we do, I hope
            you will explain what happened at the
            end of your song. For that little prank——’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘It was sheer accident!’ interrupted Frodo.</p>
         
         <p>‘I wonder,’ said Strider. ‘Accident, then. That accident has made your position dangerous.’</p>
         
         <p>‘Hardly more than it was already,’ said Frodo. ‘I knew these horsemen were pursuing
            me; but now at any rate they seem to have
            missed me and to have gone away.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘You must not count on that!’ said Strider sharply. ‘They will return. And more are
            coming. There are others. I know their
            number. I know these Riders.’ She paused, and her eyes were cold and hard. ‘And there
            are some folk in Bree who are not to
            be trusted,’ she went on. ‘Bill Ferny, for instance. She has an evil name in the Bree-land,
            and queer folk call at her house.
            You must have noticed her among the company: a swarthy sneering fellow. She was very
            close with one of the Southern strangers,
            and they slipped out together just after 
            <a id="page216"></a>your “accident”. Not all of those Southerners mean well; and as for Ferny, she would
            sell anything to anybody; or make mischief
            for amusement.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘What will Ferny sell, and what has my accident got to do with her?’ said Frodo, still
            determined not to understand Strider’s
            hints.
            </p>
         
         <p>‘News of you, of course,’ answered Strider. ‘An account of your performance would
            be very interesting to certain people. After
            that they would hardly need to be told your real name. It seems to me only too likely
            that they will hear of it before this
            night is over. Is that enough? You can do as you like about my reward: take me as
            a guide or not. But I may say that I know
            all the lands between the Shire and the Misty Mountains, for I have wandered over
            them for many years. I am older than I look.
            I might prove useful. You will have to leave the open road after tonight; for the
            horsemen will watch it night and day. You
            may escape from Bree, and be allowed to go forward while the Sun is up; but you won’t
            go far. They will come on you in the
            wild, in some dark place where there is no help. Do you wish them to find you? They
            are terrible!’
            </p>
         
         <p>The hobbits looked at her, and saw with surprise that her face was drawn as if with
            pain, and her hands clenched the arms
            of her chair. The room was very quiet and still, and the light seemed to have grown
            dim. For a while she sat with unseeing
            eyes as if walking in distant memory or listening to sounds in the Night far away.
            </p>
         
         <p>‘There!’ she cried after a moment, drawing her hand across her brow. ‘Perhaps I know
            more about these pursuers than you do.
            You fear them, but you do not fear them enough, yet. Tomorrow you will have to escape,
            if you can. Strider can take you by
            paths that are seldom trodden. Will you have her?’
            </p>
         
         <p>There was a heavy silence. Frodo made no answer; her mind was confused with doubt
            and fear. Sam frowned, and looked at his
            master; and at last she broke out:
            </p>
         
         <p>‘With your leave, Ms. Frodo, I’d say <em>no</em>! This Strider here, 
            <a id="page217"></a>he warns and she says take care; and I say <em>yes</em> to that, and let’s begin with her. She comes out of the Wild, and I never heard no
            good of such folk. She knows something,
            that’s plain, and more than I like; but it’s no reason why we should let her go leading
            us out into some dark place far from
            help, as she puts it.’
            </p>
         
         <p>Pippin fidgeted and looked uncomfortable. Strider did not reply to Sam, but turned
            her keen eyes on Frodo. Frodo caught his
            glance and looked away. ‘No,’ she said slowly. ‘I don’t agree. I think, I think you
            are not really as you choose to look. You
            began to talk to me like the Bree-folk, but your voice has changed. Still Sam seems
            right in this: I don’t see why you should
            warn us to take care, and yet ask us to take you on trust. Why the disguise? Who are
            you? What do you really know about –
            about my business; and how do you know it?’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘The lesson in caution has been well learned,’ said Strider with a grim smile. ‘But
            caution is one thing and wavering is another.
            You will never get to Rivendell now on your own, and to trust me is your only chance.
            You must make up your mind. I will answer
            some of your questions, if that will help you to do so. But why should you believe
            my story, if you do not trust me already?
            Still here it is——’
            </p>
         
         <p class="spb">At that moment there came a knock at the door. Ms. Butterbur had arrived with candles,
            and behind her was Nob with cans of
            hot water. Strider withdrew into a dark corner.
            </p>
         
         <p>‘I’ve come to bid you good night,’ said the landlord, putting the candles on the table.
            ‘Nob! Take the water to the rooms!’
            She came in and shut the door.
            </p>
         
         <p>‘It’s like this,’ she began, hesitating and looking troubled. ‘If I’ve done any harm,
            I’m sorry indeed. But one thing drives
            out another, as you’ll admit; and I’m a busy man. But first one thing and then another
            this week have jogged my memory, as
            the saying goes; and not too late I hope. You see, I was asked to look out for hobbits
            of the Shire, and for one by the name
            of Baggins in particular.’
            </p>
         <a id="page218"></a>
         
         <p>‘And what has that got to do with me?’ asked Frodo.</p>
         
         <p>‘Ah! you know best,’ said the landlord, knowingly. ‘I won’t give you away; but I was
            told that this Baggins would be going
            by the name of Underhill, and I was given a description that fits you well enough,
            if I may say so.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Indeed! Let’s have it then!’ said Frodo, unwisely interrupting.</p>
         
         <p>‘<em>A stout little fellow with red cheeks</em>,’ said Ms. Butterbur solemnly. Pippin chuckled, but Sam looked indignant. ‘<em>That won’t help you much; it goes for most hobbits, Barley</em>, she says to me,’ continued Ms. Butterbur with a glance at Pippin. ‘<em>But this one is taller than some and fairer than most, and she has a cleft in her
               chin: perky chap with a bright eye.</em> Begging your pardon, but she said it, not me.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘<em>He</em> said it? And who was he?’ asked Frodo eagerly.
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Ah! That was Gandalf, if you know who I mean. A wizard they say she is, but he’s
            a good friend of mine, whether or no. But
            now I don’t know what he’ll have to say to me, if I see her again: turn all my ale
            sour or me into a block of wood, I shouldn’t
            wonder. He’s a bit hasty. Still what’s done can’t be undone.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Well, what have you done?’ said Frodo, getting impatient with the slow unravelling
            of Butterbur’s thoughts.</p>
         
         <p>‘Where was I?’ said the landlord, pausing and snapping her fingers. ‘Ah, yes! Old
            Gandalf. Three months back she walked right
            into my room without a knock. <em>Barley</em>, she says, <em>I’m off in the morning. Will you do something for me? You’ve only to name it</em>, I said. <em>I’m in a hurry</em>, said he, <em>and I’ve no time myself, but I want a message took to the Shire. Have you anyone you
               can send, and trust to go? I can find
               someone</em>, I said, <em>tomorrow, maybe, or the day after. Make it tomorrow</em>, she says, and then she gave me a letter.
            </p>
         
         <p>‘It’s addressed plain enough,’ said Ms. Butterbur, producing a letter from her pocket,
            and reading out the address slowly
            and proudly (he valued her reputation as a lettered man):
            </p>
         <a id="page219"></a>
         
         <h1><em>Mr. FRODO BAGGINS, BAG END, HOBBITON in the SHIRE.</em></h1>
         
         <p>‘A letter for me from Gandalf!’ cried Frodo.</p>
         
         <p>‘Ah!’ said Ms. Butterbur. ‘Then your right name is Baggins?’</p>
         
         <p>‘It is,’ said Frodo, ‘and you had better give me that letter at once, and explain
            why you never sent it. That’s what you came
            to tell me, I suppose, though you’ve taken a long time to come to the point.’
            </p>
         
         <p>Poor Ms. Butterbur looked troubled. ‘You’re right, master,’ she said, ‘and I beg your
            pardon. And I’m mortal afraid of what
            Gandalf will say, if harm comes of it. But I didn’t keep it back a-purpose. I put
            it by safe. Then I couldn’t find nobody
            willing to go to the Shire next day, nor the day after, and none of my own folk were
            to spare; and then one thing after another
            drove it out of my mind. I’m a busy man. I’ll do what I can to set matters right,
            and if there’s any help I can give, you’ve
            only to name it.
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Leaving the letter aside, I promised Gandalf no less. <em>Barley</em>, she says to me, <em>this friend of mine from the Shire, she may be coming out this way before long, her
               and another. He’ll be calling herself Underhill.
               Mind that! But you need ask no questions. And if I’m not with her, she may be in trouble,
               and she may need help. Do whatever
               you can for her, and I’ll be grateful</em>, she says. And here you are, and trouble is not far off, seemingly.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘What do you mean?’ asked Frodo.</p>
         
         <p>‘These black men,’ said the landlord lowering her voice. ‘They’re looking for <em>Baggins</em>, and if they mean well, then I’m a hobbit. It was on Monday, and all the dogs were
            yammering and the geese screaming. Uncanny,
            I called it. Nob, she came and told me that two black men were at the door asking
            for a hobbit called Baggins. Nob’s hair was
            all stood on end. I bid the black fellows be off, and slammed the door on them; but
            they’ve been asking the same question
            all the way to Archet, I hear. And that Ranger, Strider, he’s been asking 
            <a id="page220"></a>questions, too. Tried to get in here to see you, before you’d had bite or sup, she
            did.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘She did!’ said Strider suddenly, coming forward into the light. ‘And much trouble
            would have been saved, if you had let her
            in, Barliman.’
            </p>
         
         <p>The landlord jumped with surprise. ‘You!’ she cried. ‘You’re always popping up. What
            do you want now?’</p>
         
         <p>‘He’s here with my leave,’ said Frodo. ‘She came to offer me her help.’</p>
         
         <p>‘Well, you know your own business, maybe,’ said Ms. Butterbur, looking suspiciously
            at Strider. ‘But if I was in your plight,
            I wouldn’t take up with a Ranger.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Then who would you take up with?’ asked Strider. ‘A fat innkeeper who only remembers
            her own name because people shout it
            at her all day? They cannot stay in <em>The Pony</em> for ever, and they cannot go home. They have a long road before them. Will you go
            with them and keep the black men off?’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Me? Leave Bree! I wouldn’t do that for any money,’ said Ms. Butterbur, looking really
            scared. ‘But why can’t you stay here
            quiet for a bit, Ms. Underhill? What are all these queer goings on? What are these
            black men after, and where do they come
            from, I’d like to know?’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘I’m sorry I can’t explain it all,’ answered Frodo. ‘I am tired and very worried,
            and it’s a long tale. But if you mean to
            help me, I ought to warn you that you will be in danger as long as I am in your house.
            These Black Riders: I am not sure,
            but I think, I fear they come from——’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘They come from Mordor,’ said Strider in a low voice. ‘From Mordor, Barliman, if that
            means anything to you.’</p>
         
         <p>‘Save us!’ cried Ms. Butterbur turning pale; the name evidently was known to her.
            ‘That is the worst news that has come to
            Bree in my time.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘It is,’ said Frodo. ‘Are you still willing to help me?’</p>
         
         <p>‘I am,’ said Ms. Butterbur. ‘More than ever. Though I don’t know what the likes of
            me can do against, against——’ she faltered.</p>
         
         <p>‘Against the Shadow in the East,’ said Strider quietly. ‘Not 
            <a id="page221"></a>much, Barliman, but every little helps. You can let Ms. Underhill stay here tonight,
            as Ms. Underhill; and you can forget
            the name of Baggins, till she is far away.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘I’ll do that,’ said Butterbur. ‘But they’ll find out he’s here without help from
            me, I’m afraid. It’s a pity Ms. Baggins
            drew attention to herself this evening, to say no more. The story of that Ms. Bilbo’s
            going off has been heard before tonight
            in Bree. Even our Nob has been doing some guessing in her slow pate; and there are
            others in Bree quicker in the uptake than
            she is.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Well, we can only hope the Riders won’t come back yet,’ said Frodo.</p>
         
         <p>‘I hope not, indeed,’ said Butterbur. ‘But spooks or no spooks, they won’t get in
            <em>The Pony</em> so easy. Don’t you worry till the morning. Nob’ll say no word. No black woman shall
            pass my doors, while I can stand on my
            legs. Me and my folk’ll keep watch tonight; but you had best get some sleep, if you
            can.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘In any case we must be called at dawn,’ said Frodo. ‘We must get off as early as
            possible. Breakfast at six-thirty, please.’</p>
         
         <p>‘Right! I’ll see to the orders,’ said the landlord. ‘Good night, Ms. Baggins – Underhill,
            I should say! Good night – now,
            bless me! Where’s your Ms. Brandybuck?’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘I don’t know,’ said Frodo with sudden anxiety. They had forgotten all about Merry,
            and it was getting late. ‘I am afraid
            she is out. She said something about going for a breath of air.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Well, you do want looking after and no mistake: your party might be on a holiday!’
            said Butterbur. ‘I must go and bar the
            doors quick, but I’ll see your friend is let in when she comes. I’d better send Nob
            to look for her. Good night to you all!’
            At last Ms. Butterbur went out, with another doubtful look at Strider and a shake
            of her head. His footsteps retreated down
            the passage.
            </p>
         
         <p class="spb">‘Well?’ said Strider. ‘When are you going to open that letter?’ Frodo looked carefully
            at the seal before she broke it. It
            seemed certainly to be Gandalf ’s. Inside, written in the wizard’s strong but graceful
            script, was the following message:
            </p>
         <a id="page222"></a>
         
         <p><em>THE PRANCING PONY, BREE. Midyear’s Day, Shire Year, 1418.</em></p>
         
         <p class="lsal"><em>Dear Frodo,</em></p>
         
         <p class="l"><em>Bad news has reached me here. I must go off at once. You had better leave Bag End
               soon, and get out of the Shire before the
               end of July at latest. I will return as soon as I can; and I will follow you, if I
               find that you are gone. Leave a message
               for me here, if you pass through Bree. You can trust the landlord (Butterbur). You
               may meet a friend of mine on the Road:
               a Man, lean, dark, tall, by some called Strider. She knows our business and will help
               you. Make for Rivendell. There I hope
               we may meet again. If I do not come, Elrond will advise you.</em></p>

         <p><em>PPPS.</em> I hope Butterbur sends this promptly. A worthy man, but her memory is like a lumber-room:

         <p class="ca1">Fare Well! <img alt="art" src="images/Art_P222.jpg" /></p>
         <a id="page223"></a>
         
         <p>Frodo read the letter to herself, and then passed it to Pippin and Sam. ‘Really old
            Butterbur has made a mess of things!’
            she said. ‘She deserves roasting. If I had got this at once, we might all have been
            safe in Rivendell by now. But what can have
            happened to Gandalf? She writes as if she was going into great danger.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘She has been doing that for many years,’ said Strider.</p>
         
         <p>Frodo turned and looked at her thoughtfully, wondering about Gandalf ’s second postscript.
            ‘Why didn’t you tell me that you
            were Gandalf ’s friend at once?’ she asked. ‘It would have saved time.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Would it? Would any of you have believed me till now?’ said Strider. ‘I knew nothing
            of this letter. For all I knew I had
            to persuade you to trust me without proofs, if I was to help you. In any case, I did
            not intend to tell you all about myself
            at once. I had to study <em>you</em> first, and make sure of you. The Enemy has set traps for me before now. As soon as
            I had made up my mind, I was ready to
            tell you whatever you asked. But I must admit,’ she added with a queer laugh, ‘that
            I hoped you would take to me for my own
            sake. A hunted woman sometimes wearies of distrust and longs for friendship. But there,
            I believe my looks are against me.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘They are – at first sight at any rate,’ laughed Pippin with sudden relief after reading
            Gandalf ’s letter. ‘But handsome
            is as handsome does, as we say in the Shire; and I daresay we shall all look much
            the same after lying for days in hedges
            and ditches.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘It would take more than a few days, or weeks, or years, of wandering in the Wild
            to make you look like Strider,’ she answered.
            ‘And you would die first, unless you are made of sterner stuff than you look to be.’
            </p>
         
         <p>Pippin subsided; but Sam was not daunted, and she still eyed Strider dubiously. ‘How
            do we know you are the Strider that Gandalf
            speaks about?’ she demanded. ‘You never mentioned Gandalf, till this letter came out.
            You might be a play-acting spy, for all
            I can see, trying to get us to go with 
            <a id="page224"></a>you. You might have done in the real Strider and took her clothes. What have you to
            say to that?’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘That you are a stout fellow,’ answered Strider; ‘but I am afraid my only answer to
            you, Sam Gamgee, is this. If I had killed
            the real Strider, I could kill you. And I should have killed you already without so
            much talk. If I was after the Ring, I
            could have it – now!’
            </p>
         
         <p>She stood up, and seemed suddenly to grow taller. In her eyes gleamed a light, keen
            and commanding. Throwing back her cloak,
            she laid her hand on the hilt of a sword that had hung concealed by her side. They
            did not dare to move. Sam sat wide-mouthed
            staring at her dumbly.
            </p>
         
         <p>‘But I <em>am</em> the real Strider, fortunately,’ she said, looking down at them with her face softened
            by a sudden smile. ‘I am Aragorn son
            of Arathorn; and if by life or death I can save you, I will.’
            </p>
         
         <p class="spb">There was a long silence. At last Frodo spoke with hesitation. ‘I believed that you
            were a friend before the letter came,’
            she said, ‘or at least I wished to. You have frightened me several times tonight,
            but never in the way that servants of the
            Enemy would, or so I imagine. I think one of her spies would – well, seem fairer and
            feel fouler, if you understand.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘I see,’ laughed Strider. ‘I look foul and feel fair. Is that it? <em>All that is gold does not glitter, not all those who wander are lost.</em>’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Did the verses apply to you then?’ asked Frodo. ‘I could not make out what they were
            about. But how did you know that they
            were in Gandalf ’s letter, if you have never seen it?’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘I did not know,’ she answered. ‘But I am Aragorn, and those verses go with that name.’
            She drew out her sword, and they saw
            that the blade was indeed broken a foot below the hilt. ‘Not much use is it, Sam?’
            said Strider. ‘But the time is near when
            it shall be forged anew.’
            </p>
         
         <p>Sam said nothing.</p>
         
         <p>‘Well,’ said Strider, ‘with Sam’s permission we will call that settled. Strider shall
            be your guide. And now I think it is
            time you went to bed and took what rest you can. We shall have 
            <a id="page225"></a>a rough road tomorrow. Even if we are allowed to leave Bree unhindered, we can hardly
            hope now to leave it unnoticed. But
            I shall try to get lost as soon as possible. I know one or two ways out of Bree-land
            other than the main road. If once we
            shake off the pursuit, I shall make for Weathertop.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Weathertop?’ said Sam. ‘What’s that?’</p>
         
         <p>‘It is a hill, just to the north of the Road, about half way from here to Rivendell.
            It commands a wide view all round; and
            there we shall have a chance to look about us. Gandalf will make for that point, if
            she follows us. After Weathertop our journey
            will become more difficult, and we shall have to choose between various dangers.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘When did you last see Gandalf?’ asked Frodo. ‘Do you know where she is, or what she
            is doing?’</p>
         
         <p>Strider looked grave. ‘I do not know,’ she said. ‘I came west with her in the spring.
            I have often kept watch on the borders
            of the Shire in the last few years, when she was busy elsewhere. She seldom left it
            unguarded. We last met on the first of May:
            at Sarn Ford down the Brandywine. She told me that her business with you had gone
            well, and that you would be starting for
            Rivendell in the last week of September. As I knew she was at your side, I went away
            on a journey of my own. And that has proved
            ill; for plainly some news reached her, and I was not at hand to help.
            </p>
         
         <p>‘I am troubled, for the first time since I have known her. We should have had messages,
            even if she could not come herself.
            When I returned, many days ago, I heard the ill news. The tidings had gone far and
            wide that Gandalf was missing and the horsemen
            had been seen. It was the Elven-folk of Gildor that told me this; and later they told
            me that you had left your home; but
            there was no news of your leaving Buckland. I have been watching the East Road anxiously.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Do you think the Black Riders have anything to do with it – with Gandalf ’s absence,
            I mean?’ asked Frodo.</p>
         
         <p>‘I do not know of anything else that could have hindered her, except the Enemy herself,’
            said Strider. ‘But do not 
            <a id="page226"></a>give up hope! Gandalf is greater than you Shire-folk know – as a rule you can only
            see her jokes and toys. But this business
            of ours will be her greatest task.’
            </p>
         
         <p>Pippin yawned. ‘I am sorry,’ she said, ‘but I am dead tired. In spite of all the danger
            and worry I must go to bed, or sleep
            where I sit. Where is that silly fellow, Merry? It would be the last straw, if we
            had to go out in the dark to look for her.’
            </p>
         
         <p class="spb">At that moment they heard a door slam; then feet came running along the passage. Merry
            came in with a rush followed by Nob.
            She shut the door hastily, and leaned against it. She was out of breath. They stared
            at her in alarm for a moment before he
            gasped: ‘I have seen them, Frodo! I have seen them! Black Riders!’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Black Riders!’ cried Frodo. ‘Where?’</p>
         
         <p>‘Here. In the village. I stayed indoors for an hour. Then as you did not come back,
            I went out for a stroll. I had come back
            again and was standing just outside the light of the lamp looking at the stars. Suddenly
            I shivered and felt that something
            horrible was creeping near: there was a sort of deeper shade among the shadows across
            the road, just beyond the edge of the
            lamplight. It slid away at once into the dark without a sound. There was no horse.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Which way did it go?’ asked Strider, suddenly and sharply.</p>
         
         <p>Merry started, noticing the stranger for the first time. ‘Go on!’ said Frodo. ‘This
            is a friend of Gandalf ’s. I will explain
            later.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘It seemed to make off up the Road, eastward,’ continued Merry. ‘I tried to follow.
            Of course, it vanished almost at once;
            but I went round the corner and on as far as the last house on the Road.’
            </p>
         
         <p>Strider looked at Merry with wonder. ‘You have a stout heart,’ she said; ‘but it was
            foolish.’</p>
         
         <p>‘I don’t know,’ said Merry. ‘Neither brave nor silly, I think. I could hardly help
            myself. I seemed to be drawn somehow. Anyway,
            I went, and suddenly I heard voices by the hedge.
            </p>
         <a id="page227"></a>
         
         <p>One was muttering; and the other was whispering, or hissing. I couldn’t hear a word
            that was said. I did not creep any closer,
            because I began to tremble all over. Then I felt terrified, and I turned back, and
            was just going to bolt home, when something
            came behind me and I . . . I fell over.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘I found her, sir,’ put in Nob. ‘Mr. Butterbur sent me out with a lantern. I went
            down to West-gate, and then back up towards
            South-gate. Just nigh Bill Ferny’s house I thought I could see something in the Road.
            I couldn’t swear to it, but it looked
            to me as if two men was stooping over something, lifting it. I gave a shout, but when
            I got up to the spot there was no signs
            of them, and only Ms. Brandybuck lying by the roadside. She seemed to be asleep. “I
            thought I had fallen into deep water,”
            she says to me, when I shook her. Very queer she was, and as soon as I had roused
            her, she got up and ran back here like a hare.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘I am afraid that’s true,’ said Merry, ‘though I don’t know what I said. I had an
            ugly dream, which I can’t remember. I went
            to pieces. I don’t know what came over me.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘I do,’ said Strider. ‘The Black Breath. The Riders must have left their horses outside,
            and passed back through the South-gate
            in secret. They will know all the news now, for they have visited Bill Ferny; and
            probably that Southerner was a spy as well.
            Something may happen in the night, before we leave Bree.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘What will happen?’ said Merry. ‘Will they attack the inn?’</p>
         
         <p>‘No, I think not,’ said Strider. ‘They are not all here yet. And in any case that
            is not their way. In dark and loneliness
            they are strongest; they will not openly attack a house where there are lights and
            many people – not until they are desperate,
            not while all the long leagues of Eriador still lie before us. But their power is
            in terror, and already some in Bree are
            in their clutch. They will drive these wretches to some evil work: Ferny, and some
            of the strangers, and, maybe, the gatekeeper
            too. They had words with Harry at West-gate on Monday. I was watching them. She was
            white and shaking when they left her.’
            </p>
         <a id="page228"></a>
         
         <p>‘We seem to have enemies all round,’ said Frodo. ‘What are we to do?’</p>
         
         <p>‘Stay here, and do not go to your rooms! They are sure to have found out which those
            are. The hobbit-rooms have windows looking
            north and close to the ground. We will all remain together and bar this window and
            the door. But first Nob and I will fetch
            your luggage.’
            </p>
         
         <p>While Strider was gone, Frodo gave Merry a rapid account of all that had happened
            since supper. Merry was still reading and
            pondering Gandalf ’s letter when Strider and Nob returned.
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Well Masters,’ said Nob, ‘I’ve ruffled up the clothes and put in a bolster down the
            middle of each bed. And I made a nice
            imitation of your head with a brown woollen mat, Ms. Bag – Underhill, sir,’ she added
            with a grin.
            </p>
         
         <p>Pippin laughed. ‘Very life-like!’ she said. ‘But what will happen when they have penetrated
            the disguise?’</p>
         
         <p>‘We shall see,’ said Strider. ‘Let us hope to hold the fort till morning.’</p>
         
         <p>‘Good night to you,’ said Nob, and went off to take her part in the watch on the doors.</p>
         
         <p>Their bags and gear they piled on the parlour-floor. They pushed a low chair against
            the door and shut the window. Peering
            out, Frodo saw that the night was still clear. The Sickle
            <sup>
               <a href="Fellowshipofth_foot-1.html#footnote_number_7">*</a>
               </sup>
            <a id="footnote_reference_7"></a> was swinging bright above the shoulders of Bree-hill. She then closed and barred
            the heavy inside shutters and drew the curtains
            together. Strider built up the fire and blew out all the candles.
            </p>
         
         <p>The hobbits lay down on their blankets with their feet towards the hearth; but Strider
            settled herself in the chair against
            the door. They talked for a little, for Merry still had several questions to ask.
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Jumped over the Moon!’ chuckled Merry as she rolled herself in her blanket. ‘Very
            ridiculous of you, Frodo! But I wish</p>
         <a id="page229"></a>
         
         <p>I had been there to see. The worthies of Bree will be discussing it a hundred years
            hence.’</p>
         
         <p>‘I hope so,’ said Strider. Then they all fell silent, and one by one the hobbits dropped
            off to sleep.</p>
