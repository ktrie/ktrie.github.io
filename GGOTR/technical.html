<p>I used XSLT to transform <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em> into a feminist text by swapping out masculine-inflected language for feminine-inflected language. I used a series of variables and templates to make multiple passes through the text to find and replace strings of characters.</p> 

<p>I don’t necessarily recommend using XSLT for this kind of project. The number of variables required quickly becomes unwieldly, and the precision in matching strings doesn’t suit the messiness of natural language.<p>

<p>The output is therefore imperfect. I made no attempt to find every masculine-inflected word in the text, and slight variations in strings (he vs. he’s, for example) mean that some male pronouns have snuck through. At the risk of overexplaining the conceit of the project, however, of course merely swapping out male characters in favor of female ones does not make a book feminist, so the result was doomed to be imperfect from the start. I do not expect that at any point the reader of the gender-swapped <em>Girl Gang of the Ring</em> will forget that the characters are in linguistic drag, and so from an artistic point of view it doesn’t matter if the occasional ‘he’s’ or 'lad' slips in. Just as in a drag show, the point is to play with gender, not to reify it.</p>


<h2>Source</h2>

<p>I cannibalized an EPUB of <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em> for the source XHTML. It is minimally marked up with attributes on paragraph elements to designate chapter number, chapter title, section breaks, and song formatting, but this doesn’t matter all that much since my templates match text.</p>

<h2>Variables</h2>

<p><a href="/GGOTR/feminizer.xsl">My transformation</a> finds and replaces strings of text. A series of variables are used to pass through the text multiple times, each time searching for a different string in the output of the previous pass. This is slow and unwieldly. To truly eradicate masculine language from the source text, I could have kept adding variables indefinitely, but I felt that to continue past 13 replacements would have diminishing returns.</p>

<h2>globalReplace</h2>

<p>The globalReplace template replaces the strings.</p>

<p>It is a little too strict for the messiness of natural language.</p> 

<p>For example, the matches are case sensitive, so ‘ his ‘ requires a different variable than ‘ His ‘. For the most part, I decided it was not economical to include both lowercase and uppercase versions of the string. The exception is ‘ he ‘ versus ‘He ‘, since ‘He’ with an initial uppercase is so often in the subject position of the sentence.</p>

<p>It also is very picky about what is on either side of the desired replacement string. Without a space on either side, ‘he’ transforms common words like the, their, and here into tshe, tsheir, and shere. Some of these are quite amusing—heir into sheir, hero into shero—but on the whole it is unreadable. With a space on either side, ‘ he ‘ misses the contraction ‘he’s’, but it didn’t happen often enough for me to make a separate ‘ he’s’ template.</p>

<p>I tried to cheat with some words: for example, ‘ him’ is often in object position in an English sentence and might therefore be followed by a comma or a period. In the template I omitted the space following so that the strings ‘ him’, ‘ him,’, and ‘ him.’ might also be matched.</p>

<p>There is probably a more elegant way to circumvent the messiness of natural language. However, from a purely artistic point of view, I have no desire to reaffirm the gender binary, so it doesn’t matter to me if the occasional ‘he’s’ slips in.</p>

<h2>Repackage as EPUB</h2>

<p>I created a project in Oxygen to apply the transformation to the 22 chapters and prologue of The Fellowship of the Ring. Because my transformation matches text and not structure, you could theoretically apply it to any book you wanted to gender swap. The only thing you would need to change is the XPath for the result document.</p>
