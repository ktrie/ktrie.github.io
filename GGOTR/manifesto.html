<p>There are no women in Middle-earth.</p>

<p>If your response to this is to reflexively interject, "What about Éowyn?", I urge you to consider that the presence of one woman, who must disguise herself as a man, may not be the trump card you believe it to be.</p>

<p>With one or two notable exceptions—shoutout to feminist icon Shelob—the women of Middle-earth exist on the periphery, relegated to the cozy domestic sphere of Shire kitchens or secluded so well in dwarven mountain halls that it is uncertain they even exist. In the movie adaptations, occasionally a woman gets to run screaming from a battle, to highlight the violation of the invader into the realm of ordinary life.</p>

<p>So it is not precisely that there are no women in Middle-earth; rather, Men and male-identified dwarves, elves, and hobbits have adventures and fight in wars, and after the battles have been won and the day has been saved, return home to ordinary life and the womenfolk they have rescued. This gendered separation of public and private spheres maps neatly onto the prejudices of our world in a way that makes women's absence from the text seem natural and in fact almost invisible. It is possible to read <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> and genuinely not notice that in roughly 800 pages, depending on your edition, there are only a handful of named female characters, because <em>of course</em> women don't fight in wars.</p>

<p>It is difficult, however, to imagine the inverse of Middle-earth—a fantasy universe in which men are as insignificant and as relegated to the periphery, and in which their absence is both unremarked on and in fact almost invisible to the reader.</p>

<p><em>The Girl Gang of the Ring</em> creates a Middle-earth in which all the characters are women, but I do not expect this will ever feel natural or invisible to the reader. In fact, I expect it to be glaringly obvious at every turn that the characters are wearing linguistic drag. You can’t “fix” <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> by adding strong female characters (though the movies have tried). The sexism of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> is ideological. The presence of women at the center of the action violates the deeply entrenched logic of this text—that women exist as symbols of goodness and domesticity and all that is not war, not as subjects in their own right, to be threatened and then saved from the forces of encroaching darkness.</p>

<p><em>The Girl Gang of the Ring</em> is intended to provoke productive discomfort with the gendered assumptions of Middle-earth and to highlight the absurdity of a mono-gender universe. And what more fitting tribute to Tolkien than to examine how language upholds the gendered ideology at play? I have made 13 replacements to the text: he, He, him, his, man, Men, father, son, nephew, uncle, Mr., king, and fellowship are swapped out for their feminine counterparts. I could have made more changes; I could have made <em>a lot</em> more changes. But the point is not to have a perfectly gender-swapped final product. The point is to show that the absence of women is not incidental—Tolkien didn’t just forget about women—but to demonstrate that the text is deeply invested in masculinity, even at the linguistic level.<p>

<p>One final note: <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> also famously has a race problem. In typical white feminist fashion, I have made no attempts to remedy this problem in <em>Girl Gang of the Ring,</em> but please know that racism is also very much not okay.</p>
