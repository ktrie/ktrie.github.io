<p>There are no women in Middle-earth. <em>The Girl Gang of the Ring</em> attempts to remedy this problem.</p>

<p>The project uses XSLT to transform <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em> into a feminist text by swapping out masculine-inflected language for feminine-inflected language.
  <a href="/GGOTR/feminizer.xsl">The transformation</a> uses a series of variables to make multiple passes through the text to find and replace strings of characters using the globalReplace template.
  Thirteen words were swapped out for their feminine counterparts: he, He, him, his, man, Men, father, son, nephew, uncle, Mr., king, and fellowship.</p>

<p>Because this transformation only ever matches at the root element, it is not document-specific. You could theoretically apply it to any book you wanted to feminize. Due to the limited number of variables and the over-precision of the string matching, 
  the output will not be perfect. But if imperfection is acceptable to you, the only thing you would need to change to feminize your own texts is the XPath for the result document.</p>
