<p>There are no women in Middle-earth.</p>

<p>If your response to this is to reflexively interject, "What about Éowyn?", I urge you to consider that the presence of one woman who must disguise herself as a man may not be the trump card you believe it to be.</p>

<p>With one or two notable exceptions—shoutout to feminist icon Shelob—the women of Middle-earth exist on the periphery, relegated to the cozy private sphere of Shire kitchens or secluded so well in dwarven mountain halls that it is uncertain they even exist.
  In the movie adaptations, occasionally a woman gets to run screaming from a battle, to highlight the violation of the invader into the realm of ordinary life.</p>
