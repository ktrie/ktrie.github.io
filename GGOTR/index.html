<p>There are no women in Middle-earth. <em>The Girl Gang of the Ring</em> attempts to remedy this problem.</p>
<p>The project uses XSLT to transform <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em> into a feminist text by swapping out masculine-inflected language for feminine-inflected language.
  <a href="/GGOTR/feminizer.xsl">The transformation</a> uses a series of variables to make multiple passes through the text to find and replace strings of characters using the globalReplace template.
  Thirteen words were swapped out for their feminine counterparts: he, He, him, his, man, Men, father, son, nephew, uncle, Mr., king, and fellowship.</p>
