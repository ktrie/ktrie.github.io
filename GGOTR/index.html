<p>There are no women in Middle-earth.</p>

<p>If your response to this is to reflexively interject, "What about Éowyn?", I urge you to consider that the presence of one woman who must disguise herself as a man may not be the trump card you believe it to be.</p>

<p>With one or two notable exceptions—shoutout to feminist icon Shelob—the women of Middle-earth exist on the periphery, relegated to the cozy private sphere of Shire kitchens or secluded so well in dwarven mountain halls that it is uncertain they even exist.
  In the movie adaptations, occasionally a woman gets to run screaming from a battle, to highlight the violation of the invader into the realm of ordinary life.</p>

<p>So it is not precisely that there are no women in Middle-earth; rather, Men and male-identified dwarves, elves, and hobbits have adventures and fight in wars, and after the day has been saved, return home to ordinary life and the womenfolk they have saved.
This gendered separation of public and private spheres maps neatly onto the prejudices of our world in a way that makes women's absence from the text seem natural and in fact almost invisible.
  It is possible to read <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> and genuinely not notice that in roughly 800 pages, depending on your edition, there are only a handful of named female characters, because <em>of course</em> women don't fight in wars.</p>

<p>It is difficult to imagine the inverse of Middle-earth—a fantasy universe in which there are no men, and their absence is both unremarked on and in fact almost invisible to the reader.</p>
