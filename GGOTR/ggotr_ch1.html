         <p class="ct"><a href="Fellowshipofth_toc.html#chap-1">A LONG-EXPECTED PARTY</a></p>
         
         <p class="cotx">When Ms. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that she would shortly be celebrating
            her eleventy-first birthday with a party
            of special magnificence, there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton.
            </p>
         
         <p>Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been the wonder of the Shire for sixty
            years, ever since her remarkable disappearance
            and unexpected return. The riches she had brought back from her travels had now become
            a local legend, and it was popularly
            believed, whatever the old folk might say, that the Hill at Bag End was full of tunnels
            stuffed with treasure. And if that
            was not enough for fame, there was also her prolonged vigour to marvel at. Time wore
            on, but it seemed to have little effect
            on Ms. Baggins. At ninety she was much the same as at fifty. At ninety-nine they began
            to call her <em>well-preserved</em>; but <em>unchanged</em> would have been nearer the mark. There were some that shook their heads and thought
            this was too much of a good thing; it
            seemed unfair that anyone should possess (apparently) perpetual youth as well as (reputedly)
            inexhaustible wealth.
            </p>
         
         <p>‘It will have to be paid for,’ they said. ‘It isn’t natural, and trouble will come
            of it!’</p>
         
         <p class="spb">But so far trouble had not come; and as Ms. Baggins was generous with her money, most
            people were willing to forgive her his
            oddities and her good fortune. She remained on visiting terms with her relatives (except,
            of course, the Sackville-Bagginses),
            and she had many devoted admirers among the hobbits of poor and unimportant families.
            But she had no close friends, until some
            of her younger cousins began to grow up.
            </p>
         
         <p>
            <a id="page28"></a>The eldest of  these, and Bilbo’s favourite, was young Frodo Baggins. When Bilbo was
            ninety-nine she adopted Frodo as her heir,
            and brought her to live at Bag End; and the hopes of the Sackville-Bagginses were
            finally dashed. Bilbo and Frodo happened
            to have the same birthday, September 22nd. ‘You had better come and live here, Frodo
            my lad,’ said Bilbo one day; ‘and then
            we can celebrate our birthday-parties comfortably together.’ At that time Frodo was
            still in her <em>tweens</em>, as the hobbits called the irresponsible twenties between childhood and coming of
            age at thirty-three.
            </p>
         
         <p class="spb">Twelve more years passed. Each year the Bagginses had given very lively combined birthday-parties
            at Bag End; but now it was
            understood that something quite exceptional was being planned for that autumn. Bilbo
            was going to be <em>eleventy-one</em>, 111, a rather curious number, and a very respectable age for a hobbit (the Old Took
            herself had only reached 130); and Frodo
            was going to be <em>thirty-three</em>, 33, an important number: the date of her ‘coming of age’.
            </p>
         
         <p>Tongues began to wag in Hobbiton and Bywater; and rumour of the coming event travelled
            all over the Shire. The history and
            character of Ms. Bilbo Baggins became once again the chief topic of conversation;
            and the older folk suddenly found their
            reminiscences in welcome demand.
            </p>
         
         <p>No one had a more attentive audience than old Ham Gamgee, commonly known as the Gaffer.
            She held forth at <em>The Ivy Bush</em>, a small inn on the Bywater road; and she spoke with some authority, for she had
            tended the garden at Bag End for forty years,
            and had helped old Holman in the same job before that. Now that she was herself growing
            old and stiff in the joints, the job
            was mainly carried on by her youngest son, Sam Gamgee. Both mother and daughter were
            on very friendly terms with Bilbo and Frodo.
            They lived on the Hill itself, in Number 3 Bagshot Row just below Bag End.
            </p>
         
         <p>‘A very nice well-spoken gentlehobbit is Ms. Bilbo, as I’ve always said,’ the Gaffer
            declared. With perfect truth: for Bilbo
            was very polite to her, calling her ‘Master Hamfast’, and 
            <a id="page29"></a>consulting her constantly upon the growing of vegetables – in the matter of ‘roots’,
            especially potatoes, the Gaffer was recognized
            as the leading authority by all in the neighbourhood (including herself ).
            </p>
         
         <p>‘But what about this Frodo that lives with her?’ asked Old Noakes of Bywater. ‘Baggins
            is her name, but he’s more than half
            a Brandybuck, they say. It beats me why any Baggins of Hobbiton should go looking
            for a wife away there in Buckland, where
            folks are so queer.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘And no wonder they’re queer,’ put in Daddy Twofoot (the Gaffer’s next-door neighbour),
            ‘if they live on the wrong side of
            the Brandywine River, and right agin the Old Forest. That’s a dark bad place, if half
            the tales be true.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘You’re right, Dad!’ said the Gaffer. ‘Not that the Brandybucks of Buckland live <em>in</em> the Old Forest; but they’re a queer breed, seemingly. They fool about with boats
            on that big river – and that isn’t natural.
            Small wonder that trouble came of it, I say. But be that as it may, Ms. Frodo is as
            nice a young hobbit as you could wish
            to meet. Very much like Ms. Bilbo, and in more than looks. After all her mother was
            a Baggins. A decent respectable hobbit
            was Ms. Drogo Baggins; there was never much to tell of her, till she was drownded.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Drownded?’ said several voices. They had heard this and other darker rumours before,
            of course; but hobbits have a passion
            for family history, and they were ready to hear it again.
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Well, so they say,’ said the Gaffer. ‘You see: Ms. Drogo, she married poor Miss Primula
            Brandybuck. She was our Ms. Bilbo’s
            first cousin on the mother’s side (her mother being the youngest of the Old Took’s
            daughters); and Ms. Drogo was her second
            cousin. So Ms. Frodo is her first <em>and</em> second cousin, once removed either way, as the saying is, if you follow me. And Ms.
            Drogo was staying at Brandy Hall with
            her father-in-law, old Master Gorbadoc, as she often did after her marriage (him being
            partial to her vittles, and old Gorbadoc
            keeping a mighty generous table); and she went out 
            <a id="page30"></a><em>boating</em> on the Brandywine River; and she and her wife were drownded, and poor Ms. Frodo only
            a child and all.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘I’ve heard they went on the water after dinner in the moonlight,’ said Old Noakes;
            ‘and it was Drogo’s weight as sunk the
            boat.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘And <em>I</em> heard she pushed her in, and she pulled her in after her,’ said Sandyman, the Hobbiton
            miller.
            </p>
         
         <p>‘You shouldn’t listen to all you hear, Sandyman,’ said the Gaffer, who did not much
            like the miller. ‘There isn’t no call
            to go talking of pushing and pulling. Boats are quite tricky enough for those that
            sit still without looking further for the
            cause of trouble. Anyway: there was this Ms. Frodo left an orphan and stranded, as
            you might say, among those queer Bucklanders,
            being brought up anyhow in Brandy Hall. A regular warren, by all accounts. Old Master
            Gorbadoc never had fewer than a couple
            of hundred relations in the place. Ms. Bilbo never did a kinder deed than when she
            brought the lad back to live among decent
            folk.
            </p>
         
         <p>‘But I reckon it was a nasty knock for those Sackville-Bagginses. They thought they
            were going to get Bag End, that time when
            she went off and was thought to be dead. And then she comes back and orders them off;
            and she goes on living and living, and
            never looking a day older, bless her! And suddenly she produces an heir, and has all
            the papers made out proper. The Sackville-Bagginses
            won’t never see the inside of Bag End now, or it is to be hoped not.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘There’s a tidy bit of money tucked away up there, I hear tell,’ said a stranger,
            a visitor on business from Michel Delving
            in the Westfarthing. ‘All the top of your hill is full of tunnels packed with chests
            of gold and silver, <em>and</em> jools, by what I’ve heard.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Then you’ve heard more than I can speak to,’ answered the Gaffer. ‘I know nothing
            about <em>jools</em>. Ms. Bilbo is free with her money, and there seems no lack of it; but I know of no
            tunnel-making. I saw Ms. Bilbo when he
            came back, a matter of sixty years ago, when I was a lad. I’d not long come prentice
            to old Holman (him being my dad’s cousin),
            but she 
            <a id="page31"></a>had me up at Bag End helping her to keep folks from trampling and trapessing all over
            the garden while the sale was on. And
            in the middle of it all Ms. Bilbo comes up the Hill with a pony and some mighty big
            bags and a couple of chests. I don’t doubt
            they were mostly full of treasure she had picked up in foreign parts, where there
            be mountains of gold, they say; but there
            wasn’t enough to fill tunnels. But my lad Sam will know more about that. He’s in and
            out of Bag End. Crazy about stories of
            the old days, she is, and she listens to all Ms. Bilbo’s tales. Ms. Bilbo has learned
            her her letters – meaning no harm, mark
            you, and I hope no harm will come of it.
            </p>
         
         <p>‘<em>Elves and Dragons!</em> I says to her. <em>Cabbages and potatoes are better for me and you. Don’t go getting mixed up in the
               business of your betters, or you’ll land
               in trouble too big for you</em>, I says to her. And I might say it to others,’ she added with a look at the stranger
            and the miller.
            </p>
         
         <p>But the Gaffer did not convince her audience. The legend of Bilbo’s wealth was now
            too firmly fixed in the minds of the younger
            generation of hobbits.
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Ah, but she has likely enough been adding to what she brought at first,’ argued the
            miller, voicing common opinion. ‘He’s often
            away from home. And look at the outlandish folk that visit her: dwarves coming at
            night, and that old wandering conjuror,
            Gandalf, and all. You can say what you like, Gaffer, but Bag End’s a queer place,
            and its folk are queerer.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘And you can say what <em>you</em> like, about what you know no more of than you do of boating, Ms. Sandyman,’ retorted
            the Gaffer, disliking the miller even
            more than usual. ‘If that’s being queer, then we could do with a bit more queerness
            in these parts. There’s some not far away
            that wouldn’t offer a pint of beer to a friend, if they lived in a hole with golden
            walls. But they do things proper at Bag
            End. Our Sam says that <em>everyone’s</em> going to be invited to the party, and there’s going to be presents, mark you, presents
            for all – this very month as is.’
            </p>
         
         
         <p class="spb">
            <a id="page32"></a>That very month was September, and as fine as you could ask. A day or two later a
            rumour (probably started by the knowledgeable
            Sam) was spread about that there were going to be fireworks – fireworks, what is more,
            such as had not been seen in the Shire
            for nigh on a century, not indeed since the Old Took died.
            </p>
         
         <p>Days passed and The Day drew nearer. An odd-looking waggon laden with odd-looking
            packages rolled into Hobbiton one evening
            and toiled up the Hill to Bag End. The startled hobbits peered out of lamplit doors
            to gape at it. It was driven by outlandish
            folk, singing strange songs: dwarves with long beards and deep hoods. A few of them
            remained at Bag End. At the end of the
            second week in September a cart came in through Bywater from the direction of Brandywine
            Bridge in broad daylight. An old
            woman was driving it all alone. She wore a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak,
            and a silver scarf. She had a long white
            beard and bushy eyebrows that stuck out beyond the brim of her hat. Small hobbit-children
            ran after the cart all through Hobbiton
            and right up the hill. It had a cargo of fireworks, as they rightly guessed. At Bilbo’s
            front door the old woman began to unload:
            there were great bundles of fireworks of all sorts and shapes, each labelled with
            a large red G <img alt="art" src="images/Art_P032a.jpg" /> and the elf-rune, <img alt="art" src="images/Art_P032b.jpg" /> .
            </p>
         
         <p>That was Gandalf ’s mark, of course, and the old woman was Gandalf the Wizard, whose
            fame in the Shire was due mainly to his
            skill with fires, smokes, and lights. His real business was far more difficult and
            dangerous, but the Shire-folk knew nothing
            about it. To them she was just one of the ‘attractions’ at the Party. Hence the excitement
            of the hobbit-children. ‘G for Grand!’
            they shouted, and the old woman smiled. They knew her by sight, though she only appeared
            in Hobbiton occasionally and never stopped
            long; but neither they nor any but the oldest of their elders had seen one of her
            firework displays – they now belonged to
            a legendary past.
            </p>
         
         <p>When the old man, helped by Bilbo and some dwarves, had finished unloading, Bilbo
            gave a few pennies away; but 
            <a id="page33"></a>not a single squib or cracker was forthcoming, to the disappointment of the onlookers.
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Run away now!’ said Gandalf. ‘You will get plenty when the time comes.’ Then she
            disappeared inside with Bilbo, and the door
            was shut. The young hobbits stared at the door in vain for a while, and then made
            off, feeling that the day of the party would
            never come.
            </p>
         
         <p class="spb">Inside Bag End, Bilbo and Gandalf were sitting at the open window of a small room
            looking out west on to the garden. The late
            afternoon was bright and peaceful. The flowers glowed red and golden: snap-dragons
            and sunflowers, and nasturtians trailing
            all over the turf walls and peeping in at the round windows.
            </p>
         
         <p>‘How bright your garden looks!’ said Gandalf.</p>
         
         <p>‘Yes,’ said Bilbo. ‘I am very fond indeed of it, and of all the dear old Shire; but
            I think I need a holiday.’</p>
         
         <p>‘You mean to go on with your plan then?’</p>
         
         <p>‘I do. I made up my mind months ago, and I haven’t changed it.’</p>
         
         <p>‘Very well. It is no good saying any more. Stick to your plan – your whole plan, mind
            – and I hope it will turn out for the
            best, for you, and for all of us.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘I hope so. Anyway I mean to enjoy myself on Thursday, and have my little joke.’</p>
         
         <p>‘Who will laugh, I wonder?’ said Gandalf, shaking her head.</p>
         
         <p>‘We shall see,’ said Bilbo.</p>
         
         <p class="spb">The next day more carts rolled up the Hill, and still more carts. There might have
            been some grumbling about ‘dealing locally’,
            but that very week orders began to pour out of Bag End for every kind of provision,
            commodity, or luxury that could be obtained
            in Hobbiton or Bywater or anywhere in the neighbourhood. People became enthusiastic;
            and they began to tick off the days on
            the calendar; and they watched eagerly for the postman, hoping for invitations.
            </p>
         
         <p>Before long the invitations began pouring out, and the 
            <a id="page34"></a>Hobbiton post-office was blocked, and the Bywater post-office was snowed under, and
            voluntary assistant postmen were called
            for. There was a constant stream of them going up the Hill, carrying hundreds of polite
            variations on <em>Thank you, I shall certainly come</em>.
            </p>
         
         <p>A notice appeared on the gate at Bag End: <small>NO ADMITTANCE EXCEPT ON PARTY BUSINESS</small>. Even those who had, or pretended to have Party Business were seldom allowed inside.
            Bilbo was busy: writing invitations,
            ticking off answers, packing up presents, and making some private preparations of
            her own. From the time of Gandalf ’s arrival
            she remained hidden from view.
            </p>
         
         <p>One morning the hobbits woke to find the large field, south of Bilbo’s front door,
            covered with ropes and poles for tents
            and pavilions. A special entrance was cut into the bank leading to the road, and wide
            steps and a large white gate were built
            there. The three hobbit-families of Bagshot Row, adjoining the field, were intensely
            interested and generally envied. Old
            Gaffer Gamgee stopped even pretending to work in her garden.
            </p>
         
         <p>The tents began to go up. There was a specially large pavilion, so big that the tree
            that grew in the field was right inside
            it, and stood proudly near one end, at the head of the chief table. Lanterns were
            hung on all its branches. More promising
            still (to the hobbits’ mind): an enormous open-air kitchen was erected in the north
            corner of the field. A draught of cooks,
            from every inn and eating-house for miles around, arrived to supplement the dwarves
            and other odd folk that were quartered
            at Bag End. Excitement rose to its height.
            </p>
         
         <p>Then the weather clouded over. That was on Wednesday the eve of the Party. Anxiety
            was intense. Then Thursday, September the
            22nd, actually dawned. The sun got up, the clouds vanished, flags were unfurled and
            the fun began.
            </p>
         
         <p>Bilbo Baggins called it a <em>party</em>, but it was really a variety of entertainments rolled into one. Practically everybody
            living near was invited. A very few
            were overlooked by accident, 
            <a id="page35"></a>but as they turned up all the same, that did not matter. Many people from other parts
            of the Shire were also asked; and there
            were even a few from outside the borders. Bilbo met the guests (and additions) at
            the new white gate in person. She gave away
            presents to all and sundry – the latter were those who went out again by a back way
            and came in again by the gate. Hobbits
            give presents to other people on their own birthdays. Not very expensive ones, as
            a rule, and not so lavishly as on this occasion;
            but it was not a bad system. Actually in Hobbiton and Bywater every day in the year
            was somebody’s birthday, so that every
            hobbit in those parts had a fair chance of at least one present at least once a week.
            But they never got tired of them.
            </p>
         
         <p>On this occasion the presents were unusually good. The hobbit-children were so excited
            that for a while they almost forgot
            about eating. There were toys the like of which they had never seen before, all beautiful
            and some obviously magical. Many
            of them had indeed been ordered a year before, and had come all the way from the Mountain
            and from Dale, and were of real
            dwarf-make.
            </p>
         
         <p>When every guest had been welcomed and was finally inside the gate, there were songs,
            dances, music, games, and, of course,
            food and drink. There were three official meals: lunch, tea, and dinner (or supper).
            But lunch and tea were marked chiefly
            by the fact that at those times all the guests were sitting down and eating together.
            At other times there were merely lots
            of people eating and drinking – continuously from elevenses until six-thirty, when
            the fireworks started.
            </p>
         
         <p>The fireworks were by Gandalf: they were not only brought by her, but designed and
            made by her; and the special effects, set
            pieces, and flights of rockets were let off by her. But there was also a generous
            distribution of squibs, crackers, backarappers,
            sparklers, torches, dwarf-candles, elf-fountains, goblin-barkers and thunder-claps.
            They were all superb. The art of Gandalf
            improved with age.
            </p>
         
         <p>There were rockets like a flight of scintillating birds singing with sweet voices.
            There were green trees with trunks of dark
            
            <a id="page36"></a>smoke: their leaves opened like a whole spring unfolding in a moment, and their shining
            branches dropped glowing flowers down
            upon the astonished hobbits, disappearing with a sweet scent just before they touched
            their upturned faces. There were fountains
            of butterflies that flew glittering into the trees; there were pillars of coloured
            fires that rose and turned into eagles,
            or sailing ships, or a phalanx of flying swans; there was a red thunderstorm and a
            shower of yellow rain; there was a forest
            of silver spears that sprang suddenly into the air with a yell like an embattled army,
            and came down again into the Water
            with a hiss like a hundred hot snakes. And there was also one last surprise, in honour
            of Bilbo, and it startled the hobbits
            exceedingly, as Gandalf intended. The lights went out. A great smoke went up. It shaped
            itself like a mountain seen in the
            distance, and began to glow at the summit. It spouted green and scarlet flames. Out
            flew a red-golden dragon – not life-size,
            but terribly life-like: fire came from her jaws, her eyes glared down; there was a
            roar, and she whizzed three times over the
            heads of the crowd. They all ducked, and many fell flat on their faces. The dragon
            passed like an express train, turned a
            somersault, and burst over Bywater with a deafening explosion.
            </p>
         
         <p>‘That is the signal for supper!’ said Bilbo. The pain and alarm vanished at once,
            and the prostrate hobbits leaped to their
            feet. There was a splendid supper for everyone; for everyone, that is, except those
            invited to the special family dinner-party.
            This was held in the great pavilion with the tree. The invitations were limited to
            twelve dozen (a number also called by the
            hobbits one Gross, though the word was not considered proper to use of people); and
            the guests were selected from all the
            families to which Bilbo and Frodo were related, with the addition of a few special
            unrelated friends (such as Gandalf ). Many
            young hobbits were included, and present by parental permission; for hobbits were
            easy-going with their children in the matter
            of sitting up late, especially when there was a chance of getting them a free meal.
            Bringing up young hobbits took a lot of
            provender.
            </p>
         
         <p>
            <a id="page37"></a>There were many Bagginses and Boffins, and also many Tooks and Brandybucks; there
            were various Grubbs (relations of Bilbo
            Baggins’ grandmother), and various Chubbs (connexions of her Took grandfather); and
            a selection of Burrowses, Bolgers, Bracegirdles,
            Brockhouses, Goodbodies, Hornblowers and Proudfoots. Some of these were only very
            distantly connected with Bilbo, and some
            had hardly ever been in Hobbiton before, as they lived in remote corners of the Shire.
            The Sackville-Bagginses were not forgotten.
            Otho and her wife Lobelia were present. They disliked Bilbo and detested Frodo, but
            so magnificent was the invitation card,
            written in golden ink, that they had felt it was impossible to refuse. Besides, their
            cousin, Bilbo, had been specializing
            in food for many years and her table had a high reputation.
            </p>
         
         <p>All the one hundred and forty-four guests expected a pleasant feast; though they rather
            dreaded the after-dinner speech of
            their host (an inevitable item). She was liable to drag in bits of what she called
            poetry; and sometimes, after a glass or two,
            would allude to the absurd adventures of her mysterious journey. The guests were not
            disappointed: they had a <em>very</em> pleasant feast, in fact an engrossing entertainment: rich, abundant, varied, and
            prolonged. The purchase of provisions fell
            almost to nothing throughout the district in the ensuing weeks; but as Bilbo’s catering
            had depleted the stocks of most of
            the stores, cellars and warehouses for miles around, that did not matter much.
            </p>
         
         <p>After the feast (more or less) came the Speech. Most of the company were, however,
            now in a tolerant mood, at that delightful
            stage which they called ‘filling up the corners’. They were sipping their favourite
            drinks, and nibbling at their favourite
            dainties, and their fears were forgotten. They were prepared to listen to anything,
            and to cheer at every full stop.
            </p>
         
         <p><em>My dear People</em>, began Bilbo, rising in her place. ‘Hear! Hear! Hear!’ they shouted, and kept on
            repeating it in chorus, seeming reluctant
            to follow their own advice. Bilbo left her place and went and stood on a chair under
            the illuminated tree. The light of the
            lanterns fell on her beaming face; the 
            <a id="page38"></a>golden buttons shone on her embroidered silk waistcoat. They could all see her standing,
            waving one hand in the air, the other
            was in her trouser-pocket.
            </p>
         
         <p><em>My dear Bagginses and Boffins</em>, she began again; <em>and my dear Tooks and Brandybucks, and Grubbs, and Chubbs, and Burrowses, and Hornblowers,
               and Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Goodbodies,
               Brockhouses and Proudfoots.</em> ‘Proud<small>FEET</small>!’ shouted an elderly hobbit from the back of the pavilion. His name, of course, was
            Proudfoot, and well merited; her feet
            were large, exceptionally furry, and both were on the table.
            </p>
         
         <p><em>Proudfoots</em>, repeated Bilbo. <em>Also my good Sackville-Bagginses that I welcome back at last to Bag End. Today is
               my one hundred and eleventh birthday: I
               am eleventy-one today!</em> ‘Hurray! Hurray! Many Happy Returns!’ they shouted, and they hammered joyously on
            the tables. Bilbo was doing splendidly.
            This was the sort of stuff they liked: short and obvious.
            </p>
         
         <p><em>I hope you are all enjoying yourselves as much as I am.</em> Deafening cheers. Cries of <em>Yes</em> (and <em>No</em>). Noises of trumpets and horns, pipes and flutes, and other musical instruments.
            There were, as has been said, many young
            hobbits present. Hundreds of musical crackers had been pulled. Most of them bore the
            mark dale on them; which did not convey
            much to most of the hobbits, but they all agreed they were marvellous crackers. They
            contained instruments, small, but of
            perfect make and enchanting tones. Indeed, in one corner some of the young Tooks and
            Brandybucks, supposing Uncle Bilbo to
            have finished (since she had plainly said all that was necessary), now got up an impromptu
            orchestra, and began a merry dance-tune.
            Master Everard Took and Miss Melilot Brandybuck got on a table and with bells in their
            hands began to dance the Springle-ring:
            a pretty dance, but rather vigorous.
            </p>
         
         <p>But Bilbo had not finished. Seizing a horn from a youngster nearby, she blew three
            loud hoots. The noise subsided. <em>I shall not keep you long</em>, she cried. Cheers from all the assembly. <em>I have called you all together for a Purpose.</em> Something in the way that she said this made an impression. There was almost 
            <a id="page39"></a>silence, and one or two of the Tooks pricked up their ears.
            </p>
         
         <p><em>Indeed, for Three Purposes! First of all, to tell you that I am immensely fond of
               you all, and that eleventy-one years is
               too short a time to live among such excellent and admirable hobbits.</em> Tremendous outburst of approval.
            </p>
         
         <p><em>I don’t know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like less than half
               of you half as well as you deserve.</em> This was unexpected and rather difficult. There was some scattered clapping, but
            most of them were trying to work it out
            and see if it came to a compliment.
            </p>
         
         <p><em>Secondly, to celebrate my birthday.</em> Cheers again. <em>I should say: OUR birthday. For it is, of course, also the birthday of my heir and
               nephew, Frodo. She comes of age and into
               her inheritance today.</em> Some perfunctory clapping by the elders; and some loud shouts of ‘Frodo! Frodo! Jolly
            old Frodo,’ from the juniors. The Sackville-Bagginses
            scowled, and wondered what was meant by ‘coming into her inheritance’.
            </p>
         
         <p><em>Together we score one hundred and forty-four. Your numbers were chosen to fit this
               remarkable total: One Gross, if I may use
               the expression.</em> No cheers. This was ridiculous. Many of the guests, and especially the Sackville-Bagginses,
            were insulted, feeling sure they
            had only been asked to fill up the required number, like goods in a package. ‘One
            Gross, indeed! Vulgar expression.’
            </p>
         
         <p><em>It is also, if I may be allowed to refer to ancient history, the anniversary of my
               arrival by barrel at Esgaroth on the Long
               Lake; though the fact that it was my birthday slipped my memory on that occasion.
               I was only fifty-one then, and birthdays
               did not seem so important. The banquet was very splendid, however, though I had a
               bad cold at the time, I remember, and could
               only say ‘thag you very buch’. I now repeat it more correctly: Thank you very much
               for coming to my little party.</em> Obstinate silence. They all feared that a song or some poetry was now imminent; and
            they were getting bored. Why couldn’t
            she stop talking and let them drink her health? But Bilbo did not sing or recite.
            She paused for a moment.
            </p>
         
         <p><em>Thirdly and finally</em>, she said, <em>I wish to make an</em> <a id="page40"></a><em>ANNOUNCEMENT.</em> She spoke this last word so loudly and suddenly that everyone sat up who still could.
            <em>I regret to announce that – though, as I said, eleventy-one years is far too short
               a time to spend among you – this is the
               END. I am going. I am leaving NOW. GOOD-BYE!</em></p>
         
         <p class="spb">He stepped down and vanished. There was a blinding flash of light, and the guests
            all blinked. When they opened their eyes
            Bilbo was nowhere to be seen. One hundred and forty-four flabbergasted hobbits sat
            back speechless. Old Odo Proudfoot removed
            her feet from the table and stamped. Then there was a dead silence, until suddenly,
            after several deep breaths, every Baggins,
            Boffin, Took, Brandybuck, Grubb, Chubb, Burrows, Bolger, Bracegirdle, Brockhouse,
            Goodbody, Hornblower, and Proudfoot began
            to talk at once.
            </p>
         
         <p>It was generally agreed that the joke was in very bad taste, and more food and drink
            were needed to cure the guests of shock
            and annoyance. ‘He’s mad. I always said so,’ was probably the most popular comment.
            Even the Tooks (with a few exceptions)
            thought Bilbo’s behaviour was absurd. For the moment most of them took it for granted
            that her disappearance was nothing more
            than a ridiculous prank.
            </p>
         
         <p>But old Rory Brandybuck was not so sure. Neither age nor an enormous dinner had clouded
            her wits, and she said to her daughter-in-law,
            Esmeralda: ‘There’s something fishy in this, my dear! I believe that mad Baggins is
            off again. Silly old fool. But why worry?
            She hasn’t taken the vittles with her.’ She called loudly to Frodo to send the wine
            round again.
            </p>
         
         <p>Frodo was the only one present who had said nothing. For some time she had sat silent
            beside Bilbo’s empty chair, and ignored
            all remarks and questions. She had enjoyed the joke, of course, even though she had
            been in the know. She had difficulty in keeping
            from laughter at the indignant surprise of the guests. But at the same time she felt
            deeply troubled: she realized suddenly
            that she loved the old hobbit dearly. Most of the guests went on eating and drinking
            and discussing Bilbo Baggins’ oddities,
            past and present; but the Sackville-Bagginses 
            <a id="page41"></a>had already departed in wrath. Frodo did not want to have any more to do with the
            party. She gave orders for more wine to be
            served; then she got up and drained her own glass silently to the health of Bilbo,
            and slipped out of the pavilion.
            </p>
         
         <p class="spb">As for Bilbo Baggins, even while she was making her speech, she had been fingering
            the golden ring in her pocket: her magic
            ring that she had kept secret for so many years. As she stepped down she slipped it
            on her finger, and she was never seen by any
            hobbit in Hobbiton again.
            </p>
         
         <p>He walked briskly back to her hole, and stood for a moment listening with a smile
            to the din in the pavilion, and to the sounds
            of merrymaking in other parts of the field. Then she went in. She took off her party
            clothes, folded up and wrapped in tissue-paper
            her embroidered silk waistcoat, and put it away. Then she put on quickly some old
            untidy garments, and fastened round her waist
            a worn leather belt. On it she hung a short sword in a battered black-leather scabbard.
            From a locked drawer, smelling of moth-balls,
            she took out an old cloak and hood. They had been locked up as if they were very precious,
            but they were so patched and weatherstained
            that their original colour could hardly be guessed: it might have been dark green.
            They were rather too large for her. He
            then went into her study, and from a large strong-box took out a bundle wrapped in
            old cloths, and a leather-bound manuscript;
            and also a large bulky envelope. The book and bundle she stuffed into the top of a
            heavy bag that was standing there, already
            nearly full. Into the envelope she slipped her golden ring, and its fine chain, and
            then sealed it, and addressed it to Frodo.
            At first she put it on the mantelpiece, but suddenly she removed it and stuck it in
            her pocket. At that moment the door opened
            and Gandalf came quickly in.
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Hullo!’ said Bilbo. ‘I wondered if you would turn up.’</p>
         
         <p>‘I am glad to find you visible,’ replied the wizard, sitting down in a chair, ‘I wanted
            to catch you and have a few 
            <a id="page42"></a>final words. I suppose you feel that everything has gone off splendidly and according
            to plan?’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Yes, I do,’ said Bilbo. ‘Though that flash was surprising: it quite startled me,
            let alone the others. A little addition
            of your own, I suppose?’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘It was. You have wisely kept that ring secret all these years, and it seemed to me
            necessary to give your guests something
            else that would seem to explain your sudden vanishment.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘And would spoil my joke. You are an interfering old busybody,’ laughed Bilbo, ‘but
            I expect you know best, as usual.’</p>
         
         <p>‘I do – when I know anything. But I don’t feel too sure about this whole affair. It
            has now come to the final point. You have
            had your joke, and alarmed or offended most of your relations, and given the whole
            Shire something to talk about for nine
            days, or ninety-nine more likely. Are you going any further?’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Yes, I am. I feel I need a holiday, a very long holiday, as I have told you before.
            Probably a permanent holiday: I don’t
            expect I shall return. In fact, I don’t mean to, and I have made all arrangements.
            </p>
         
         <p>‘I am old, Gandalf. I don’t look it, but I am beginning to feel it in my heart of
            hearts. <em>Well-preserved</em> indeed!’ she snorted. ‘Why, I feel all thin, sort of <em>stretched</em>, if you know what I mean: like butter that has been scraped over too much bread.
            That can’t be right. I need a change, or
            something.’
            </p>
         
         <p>Gandalf looked curiously and closely at her. ‘No, it does not seem right,’ she said
            thoughtfully. ‘No, after all I believe
            your plan is probably the best.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Well, I’ve made up my mind, anyway. I want to see mountains again, Gandalf – <em>mountains</em>; and then find somewhere where I can <em>rest</em>. In peace and quiet, without a lot of relatives prying around, and a string of confounded
            visitors hanging on the bell. I
            might find somewhere where I can finish my book. I have thought of a nice ending for
            it: <em>and she lived happily ever after to the end of her days.</em>’
            </p>
         
         <p>Gandalf laughed. ‘I hope she will. But nobody will read the book, however it ends.’</p>
         <a id="page43"></a>
         
         <p>‘Oh, they may, in years to come. Frodo has read some already, as far as it has gone.
            You’ll keep an eye on Frodo, won’t you?’</p>
         
         <p>‘Yes, I will – two eyes, as often as I can spare them.’</p>
         
         <p>‘He would come with me, of course, if I asked her. In fact she offered to once, just
            before the party. But she does not really
            want to, yet. I want to see the wild country again before I die, and the Mountains;
            but she is still in love with the Shire,
            with woods and fields and little rivers. She ought to be comfortable here. I am leaving
            everything to her, of course, except
            a few oddments. I hope she will be happy, when she gets used to being on her own.
            It’s time she was her own master now.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Everything?’ said Gandalf. ‘The ring as well? You agreed to that, you remember.’</p>
         
         <p>‘Well, er, yes, I suppose so,’ stammered Bilbo. ‘Where is it?’</p>
         
         <p>‘In an envelope, if you must know,’ said Bilbo impatiently. ‘There on the mantelpiece.
            Well, no! Here it is in my pocket!’
            She hesitated. ‘Isn’t that odd now?’ she said softly to herself. ‘Yet after all, why
            not? Why shouldn’t it stay there?’
            </p>
         
         <p>Gandalf looked again very hard at Bilbo, and there was a gleam in her eyes. ‘I think,
            Bilbo,’ she said quietly, ‘I should leave
            it behind. Don’t you want to?’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Well yes – and no. Now it comes to it, I don’t like parting with it at all, I may
            say. And I don’t really see why I should.
            Why do you want me to?’ she asked, and a curious change came over her voice. It was
            sharp with suspicion and annoyance. ‘You
            are always badgering me about my ring; but you have never bothered me about the other
            things that I got on my journey.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘No, but I had to badger you,’ said Gandalf. ‘I wanted the truth. It was important.
            Magic rings are – well, magical; and they
            are rare and curious. I was professionally interested in your ring, you may say; and
            I still am. I should like to know where
            it is, if you go wandering again. Also I think <em>you</em> have 
            <a id="page44"></a>had it quite long enough. You won’t need it any more, Bilbo, unless I am quite mistaken.’
            </p>
         
         <p>Bilbo flushed, and there was an angry light in her eyes. His kindly face grew hard.
            ‘Why not?’ she cried. ‘And what business
            is it of yours, anyway, to know what I do with my own things? It is my own. I found
            it. It came to me.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Yes, yes,’ said Gandalf. ‘But there is no need to get angry.’</p>
         
         <p>‘If I am it is your fault,’ said Bilbo. ‘It is mine, I tell you. My own. My Precious.
            Yes, my Precious.’</p>
         
         <p>The wizard’s face remained grave and attentive, and only a flicker in her deep eyes
            showed that she was startled and indeed
            alarmed. ‘It has been called that before,’ she said, ‘but not by you.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘But I say it now. And why not? Even if Gollum said the same once. It’s not her now,
            but mine. And I shall keep it, I say.’</p>
         
         <p>Gandalf stood up. She spoke sternly. ‘You will be a fool if you do, Bilbo,’ she said.
            ‘You make that clearer with every word
            you say. It has got far too much hold on you. Let it go! And then you can go yourself,
            and be free.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘I’ll do as I choose and go as I please,’ said Bilbo obstinately.</p>
         
         <p>‘Now, now, my dear hobbit!’ said Gandalf. ‘All your long life we have been friends,
            and you owe me something. Come! Do as
            you promised: give it up!’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Well, if you want my ring yourself, say so!’ cried Bilbo. ‘But you won’t get it.
            I won’t give my Precious away, I tell you.’
            His hand strayed to the hilt of her small sword.
            </p>
         
         <p>Gandalf ’s eyes flashed. ‘It will be my turn to get angry soon,’ she said. ‘If you
            say that again, I shall. Then you will see
            Gandalf the Grey uncloaked.’ She took a step towards the hobbit, and she seemed to
            grow tall and menacing; her shadow filled
            the little room.
            </p>
         
         <p>Bilbo backed away to the wall, breathing hard, her hand clutching at her pocket. They
            stood for a while facing one another,
            and the air of the room tingled. Gandalf ’s eyes remained bent on the hobbit. Slowly
            her hands relaxed, and she began to tremble.
            </p>
         <a id="page45"></a>
         
         <p>‘I don’t know what has come over you, Gandalf,’ she said. ‘You have never been like
            this before. What is it all about? It is
            mine isn’t it? I found it, and Gollum would have killed me, if I hadn’t kept it. I’m
            not a thief, whatever she said.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘I have never called you one,’ Gandalf answered. ‘And I am not one either. I am not
            trying to rob you, but to help you. I
            wish you would trust me, as you used.’ She turned away, and the shadow passed. She
            seemed to dwindle again to an old grey man,
            bent and troubled.
            </p>
         
         <p>Bilbo drew her hand over her eyes. ‘I am sorry,’ she said. ‘But I felt so queer. And
            yet it would be a relief in a way not
            to be bothered with it any more. It has been so growing on my mind lately. Sometimes
            I have felt it was like an eye looking
            at me. And I am always wanting to put it on and disappear, don’t you know; or wondering
            if it is safe, and pulling it out
            to make sure. I tried locking it up, but I found I couldn’t rest without it in my
            pocket. I don’t know why. And I don’t seem
            able to make up my mind.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Then trust mine,’ said Gandalf. ‘It is quite made up. Go away and leave it behind.
            Stop possessing it. Give it to Frodo,
            and I will look after her.’
            </p>
         
         <p>Bilbo stood for a moment tense and undecided. Presently she sighed. ‘All right,’ she
            said with an effort. ‘I will.’ Then he
            shrugged her shoulders, and smiled rather ruefully. ‘After all that’s what this party
            business was all about, really: to give
            away lots of birthday-presents, and somehow make it easier to give it away at the
            same time. It hasn’t made it any easier
            in the end, but it would be a pity to waste all my preparations. It would quite spoil
            the joke.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Indeed it would take away the only point I ever saw in the affair,’ said Gandalf.</p>
         
         <p>‘Very well,’ said Bilbo, ‘it goes to Frodo with all the rest.’ She drew a deep breath.
            ‘And now I really must be starting,
            or somebody else will catch me. I have said good-bye, and I couldn’t bear to do it
            all over again.’ She picked up her bag and
            moved to the door.
            </p>
         
         <p>‘You have still got the ring in your pocket,’ said the wizard.</p>
         <a id="page46"></a>
         
         <p>‘Well, so I have!’ cried Bilbo. ‘And my will and all the other documents too. You
            had better take it and deliver it for me.
            That will be safest.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘No, don’t give the ring to me,’ said Gandalf. ‘Put it on the mantelpiece. It will
            be safe enough there, till Frodo comes.
            I shall wait for her.’
            </p>
         
         <p>Bilbo took out the envelope, but just as she was about to set it by the clock, her
            hand jerked back, and the packet fell on
            the floor. Before she could pick it up, the wizard stooped and seized it and set it
            in its place. A spasm of anger passed swiftly
            over the hobbit’s face again. Suddenly it gave way to a look of relief and a laugh.
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Well, that’s that,’ she said. ‘Now I’m off!’</p>
         
         <p>They went out into the hall. Bilbo chose her favourite stick from the stand; then
            she whistled. Three dwarves came out of different
            rooms where they had been busy.
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Is everything ready?’ asked Bilbo. ‘Everything packed and labelled?’</p>
         
         <p>‘Everything,’ they answered.</p>
         
         <p>‘Well, let’s start then!’ She stepped out of the front-door.</p>
         
         <p>It was a fine night, and the black sky was dotted with stars. She looked up, sniffing
            the air. ‘What fun! What fun to be off
            again, off on the Road with dwarves! This is what I have really been longing for,
            for years! Good-bye!’ she said, looking at
            her old home and bowing to the door. ‘Good-bye, Gandalf!’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Good-bye, for the present, Bilbo. Take care of yourself! You are old enough, and
            perhaps wise enough.’</p>
         
         <p>‘Take care! I don’t care. Don’t you worry about me! I am as happy now as I have ever
            been, and that is saying a great deal.
            But the time has come. I am being swept off my feet at last,’ she added, and then
            in a low voice, as if to herself, she sang
            softly in the dark:
            </p>
         
         <p class="vext1"><em>The Road goes ever on and on</em></p>
         
         <p class="vex-t"><em>Down from the door where it began.</em></p>
         
         <p class="vext"><em>Now far ahead the Road has gone,</em></p>
         
         <p class="vex-t"><em>And I must follow, if I can,</em></p>
         <a id="page47"></a>
         
         <p class="vext"><em>Pursuing it with eager feet,</em></p>
         
         <p class="vex-t"><em>Until it joins some larger way</em></p>
         
         <p class="vext"><em>Where many paths and errands meet.</em></p>
         
         <p class="vext3"><em>And whither then? I cannot say.</em></p>
         
         <p class="p1">He paused, silent for a moment. Then without another word she turned away from the
            lights and voices in the field and tents,
            and followed by her three companions went round into her garden, and trotted down
            the long sloping path. She jumped over a
            low place in the hedge at the bottom, and took to the meadows, passing into the night
            like a rustle of wind in the grass.
            </p>
         
         <p>Gandalf remained for a while staring after her into the darkness. ‘Good-bye, my dear
            Bilbo – until our next meeting!’ she said
            softly and went back indoors.
            </p>
         
         <p class="spb">Frodo came in soon afterwards, and found her sitting in the dark, deep in thought.
            ‘Has she gone?’ she asked.</p>
         
         <p>‘Yes,’ answered Gandalf, ‘he has gone at last.’</p>
         
         <p>‘I wish – I mean, I hoped until this evening that it was only a joke,’ said Frodo.
            ‘But I knew in my heart that she really
            meant to go. She always used to joke about serious things. I wish I had come back
            sooner, just to see her off.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘I think really she preferred slipping off quietly in the end,’ said Gandalf. ‘Don’t
            be too troubled. He’ll be all right –
            now. She left a packet for you. There it is!’
            </p>
         
         <p>Frodo took the envelope from the mantelpiece, and glanced at it, but did not open
            it.</p>
         
         <p>‘You’ll find her will and all the other documents in there, I think,’ said the wizard.
            ‘You are the master of Bag End now.
            And also, I fancy, you’ll find a golden ring.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘The ring!’ exclaimed Frodo. ‘Has she left me that? I wonder why. Still, it may be
            useful.’</p>
         
         <p>‘It may, and it may not,’ said Gandalf. ‘I should not make use of it, if I were you.
            But keep it secret, and keep it safe!
            Now I am going to bed.’
            </p>
         
         
         <p class="spb">
            <a id="page48"></a>As master of Bag End Frodo felt it her painful duty to say good-bye to the guests.
            Rumours of strange events had by now spread
            all over the field, but Frodo would only say <em>no doubt everything will be cleared up in the morning</em>. About midnight carriages came for the important folk. One by one they rolled away,
            filled with full but very unsatisfied
            hobbits. Gardeners came by arrangement, and removed in wheelbarrows those that had
            inadvertently remained behind.
            </p>
         
         <p>Night slowly passed. The sun rose. The hobbits rose rather later. Morning went on.
            People came and began (by orders) to clear
            away the pavilions and the tables and the chairs, and the spoons and knives and bottles
            and plates, and the lanterns, and
            the flowering shrubs in boxes, and the crumbs and cracker-paper, the forgotten bags
            and gloves and handkerchiefs, and the
            uneaten food (a very small item). Then a number of other people came (without orders):
            Bagginses, and Boffins, and Bolgers,
            and Tooks, and other guests that lived or were staying near. By mid-day, when even
            the best-fed were out and about again,
            there was a large crowd at Bag End, uninvited but not unexpected.
            </p>
         
         <p>Frodo was waiting on the step, smiling, but looking rather tired and worried. She
            welcomed all the callers, but she had not
            much more to say than before. His reply to all inquiries was simply this: ‘Mr. Bilbo
            Baggins has gone away; as far as I know,
            for good.’ Some of the visitors she invited to come inside, as Bilbo had left ‘messages’
            for them.
            </p>
         
         <p>Inside in the hall there was piled a large assortment of packages and parcels and
            small articles of furniture. On every item
            there was a label tied. There were several labels of this sort:
            </p>
         
         <p><em>For ADELARD TOOK, for her VERY OWN, from Bilbo</em>;on an umbrella. Adelard had carried off many unlabelled ones.
            </p>
         
         <p><em>For DORA BAGGINS in memory of a LONG correspondence, with love from Bilbo</em>; on a large waste-paper basket. Dora was Drogo’s sister and the eldest surviving
            female relative of Bilbo and Frodo; she
            was ninety-nine, and had written reams of good advice for more than half a century.
            </p>
         
         <p>
            <a id="page49"></a><em>For MILO BURROWS, hoping it will be useful, from B.B.</em>; on a gold pen and ink-bottle. Milo never answered letters.
            </p>
         
         <p><em>For ANGELICA’S use, from Uncle Bilbo</em>; on a round convex mirror. She was a young Baggins, and too obviously considered
            her face shapely.
            </p>
         
         <p><em>For the collection of HUGO BRACEGIRDLE, from a contributor</em>; on an (empty) book-case. Hugo was a great borrower of books, and worse than usual
            at returning them.
            </p>
         
         <p><em>For LOBELIA SACKVILLE-BAGGINS, as a PRESENT</em>; on a case of silver spoons. Bilbo believed that she had acquired a good many of
            her spoons, while she was away on her former
            journey. Lobelia knew that quite well. When she arrived later in the day, she took
            the point at once, but she also took the
            spoons.
            </p>
         
         <p class="spb">This is only a small selection of the assembled presents. Bilbo’s residence had got
            rather cluttered up with things in the
            course of her long life. It was a tendency of hobbit-holes to get cluttered up: for
            which the custom of giving so many birthday-presents
            was largely responsible. Not, of course, that the birthday-presents were always <em>new</em>; there were one or two old <em>mathoms</em> of forgotten uses that had circulated all around the district; but Bilbo had usually
            given new presents, and kept those that
            she received. The old hole was now being cleared a little.
            </p>
         
         <p>Every one of the various parting gifts had labels, written out personally by Bilbo,
            and several had some point, or some joke.
            But, of course, most of the things were given where they would be wanted and welcome.
            The poorer hobbits, and especially those
            of Bagshot Row, did very well. Old Gaffer Gamgee got two sacks of potatoes, a new
            spade, a woollen waistcoat, and a bottle
            of ointment for creaking joints. Old Rory Brandybuck, in return for much hospitality,
            got a dozen bottles of Old Winyards:
            a strong red wine from the Southfarthing, and now quite mature, as it had been laid
            down by Bilbo’s father. Rory quite forgave
            Bilbo, and voted her a capital fellow after the first bottle.
            </p>
         
         <p>
            <a id="page50"></a>There was plenty of everything left for Frodo. And, of course, all the chief treasures,
            as well as the books, pictures, and
            more than enough furniture, were left in her possession. There was, however, no sign
            nor mention of money or jewellery: not
            a penny-piece or a glass bead was given away.
            </p>
         
         <p class="spb">Frodo had a very trying time that afternoon. A false rumour that the whole household
            was being distributed free spread like
            wildfire; and before long the place was packed with people who had no business there,
            but could not be kept out. Labels got
            torn off and mixed, and quarrels broke out. Some people tried to do swaps and deals
            in the hall; and others tried to make
            off with minor items not addressed to them, or with anything that seemed unwanted
            or unwatched. The road to the gate was blocked
            with barrows and handcarts.
            </p>
         
         <p>In the middle of the commotion the Sackville-Bagginses arrived. Frodo had retired
            for a while and left her friend Merry Brandybuck
            to keep an eye on things. When Otho loudly demanded to see Frodo, Merry bowed politely.
            </p>
         
         <p>‘He is indisposed,’ she said. ‘He is resting.’</p>
         
         <p>‘Hiding, you mean,’ said Lobelia. ‘Anyway we want to see her and we mean to see her.
            Just go and tell her so!’</p>
         
         <p>Merry left them a long while in the hall, and they had time to discover their parting
            gift of spoons. It did not improve their
            tempers. Eventually they were shown into the study. Frodo was sitting at a table with
            a lot of papers in front of her. He
            looked indisposed – to see Sackville-Bagginses at any rate; and she stood up, fidgeting
            with something in her pocket. But he
            spoke quite politely.
            </p>
         
         <p>The Sackville-Bagginses were rather offensive. They began by offering her bad bargain-prices
            (as between friends) for various
            valuable and unlabelled things. When Frodo replied that only the things specially
            directed by Bilbo were being given away,
            they said the whole affair was very fishy.
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Only one thing is clear to me,’ said Otho, ‘and that is that you are doing exceedingly
            well out of it. I insist on seeing
            the will.’
            </p>
         
         <p>
            <a id="page51"></a>Otho would have been Bilbo’s heir, but for the adoption of Frodo. She read the will
            carefully and snorted. It was, unfortunately,
            very clear and correct (according to the legal customs of hobbits, which demand among
            other things seven signatures of witnesses
            in red ink).
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Foiled again!’ she said to her wife. ‘And after waiting <em>sixty</em> years. Spoons? Fiddlesticks!’ She snapped her fingers under Frodo’s nose and stumped
            off. But Lobelia was not so easily got
            rid of. A little later Frodo came out of the study to see how things were going on,
            and found her still about the place, investigating
            nooks and corners, and tapping the floors. She escorted her firmly off the premises,
            after she had relieved her of several small
            (but rather valuable) articles that had somehow fallen inside her umbrella. Her face
            looked as if she was in the throes of
            thinking out a really crushing parting remark; but all she found to say, turning round
            on the step, was:
            </p>
         
         <p>‘You’ll live to regret it, young fellow! Why didn’t you go too? You don’t belong here;
            you’re no Baggins – you – you’re a
            Brandybuck!’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Did you hear that, Merry? That was an insult, if you like,’ said Frodo as she shut
            the door on her.</p>
         
         <p>‘It was a compliment,’ said Merry Brandybuck, ‘and so, of course, not true.’</p>
         
         <p class="spb">Then they went round the hole, and evicted three young hobbits (two Boffins and a
            Bolger) who were knocking holes in the walls
            of one of the cellars. Frodo also had a tussle with young Sancho Proudfoot (old Odo
            Proudfoot’s grandson), who had begun an
            excavation in the larger pantry, where she thought there was an echo. The legend of
            Bilbo’s gold excited both curiosity and
            hope; for legendary gold (mysteriously obtained, if not positively ill-gotten), is,
            as everyone knows, anyone’s for the finding
            – unless the search is interrupted.
            </p>
         
         <p>When she had overcome Sancho and pushed her out, Frodo collapsed on a chair in the
            hall. ‘It’s time to close the shop, Merry,’
            she said. ‘Lock the door, and don’t open it to 
            <a id="page52"></a>anyone today, not even if they bring a battering ram.’ Then she went to revive herself
            with a belated cup of tea.
            </p>
         
         <p>He had hardly sat down, when there came a soft knock at the front-door. ‘Lobelia again
            most likely,’ she thought. ‘She must
            have thought of something really nasty, and have come back again to say it. It can
            wait.’
            </p>
         
         <p>He went on with her tea. The knock was repeated, much louder, but she took no notice.
            Suddenly the wizard’s head appeared at
            the window.
            </p>
         
         <p>‘If you don’t let me in, Frodo, I shall blow your door right down your hole and out
            through the hill,’ she said.</p>
         
         <p>‘My dear Gandalf! Half a minute!’ cried Frodo, running out of the room to the door.
            ‘Come in! Come in! I thought it was Lobelia.’</p>
         
         <p>‘Then I forgive you. But I saw her some time ago, driving a pony-trap towards Bywater
            with a face that would have curdled
            new milk.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘She had already nearly curdled me. Honestly, I nearly tried on Bilbo’s ring. I longed
            to disappear.’</p>
         
         <p>‘Don’t do that!’ said Gandalf, sitting down. ‘Do be careful of that ring, Frodo! In
            fact, it is partly about that that I have
            come to say a last word.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Well, what about it?’</p>
         
         <p>‘What do you know already?’</p>
         
         <p>‘Only what Bilbo told me. I have heard her story: how she found it, and how she used
            it: on her journey, I mean.’</p>
         
         <p>‘Which story, I wonder,’ said Gandalf.</p>
         
         <p>‘Oh, not what she told the dwarves and put in her book,’ said Frodo. ‘He told me the
            true story soon after I came to live here.
            She said you had pestered her till she told you, so I had better know too. “No secrets
            between us, Frodo,” she said; “but they
            are not to go any further. It’s mine anyway.” ’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘That’s interesting,’ said Gandalf. ‘Well, what did you think of it all?’</p>
         
         <p>‘If you mean, inventing all that about a “present”, well, I thought the true story
            much more likely, and I couldn’t see 
            <a id="page53"></a>the point of altering it at all. It was very unlike Bilbo to do so, anyway; and I
            thought it rather odd.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘So did I. But odd things may happen to people that have such treasures – if they
            use them. Let it be a warning to you to
            be very careful with it. It may have other powers than just making you vanish when
            you wish to.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘I don’t understand,’ said Frodo.</p>
         
         <p>‘Neither do I,’ answered the wizard. ‘I have merely begun to wonder about the ring,
            especially since last night. No need to
            worry. But if you take my advice you will use it very seldom, or not at all. At least
            I beg you not to use it in any way that
            will cause talk or rouse suspicion. I say again: keep it safe, and keep it secret!’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘You are very mysterious! What are you afraid of?’</p>
         
         <p>‘I am not certain, so I will say no more. I may be able to tell you something when
            I come back. I am going off at once: so
            this is good-bye for the present.’ She got up.
            </p>
         
         <p>‘At once!’ cried Frodo. ‘Why, I thought you were staying on for at least a week. I
            was looking forward to your help.’</p>
         
         <p>‘I did mean to – but I have had to change my mind. I may be away for a good while;
            but I’ll come and see you again, as soon
            as I can. Expect me when you see me! I shall slip in quietly. I shan’t often be visiting
            the Shire openly again. I find that
            I have become rather unpopular. They say I am a nuisance and a disturber of the peace.
            Some people are actually accusing me
            of spiriting Bilbo away, or worse. If you want to know, there is supposed to be a
            plot between you and me to get hold of his
            wealth.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘Some people!’ exclaimed Frodo. ‘You mean Otho and Lobelia. How abominable! I would
            give them Bag End and everything else,
            if I could get Bilbo back and go off tramping in the country with her. I love the
            Shire. But I begin to wish, somehow, that
            I had gone too. I wonder if I shall ever see her again.’
            </p>
         
         <p>‘So do I,’ said Gandalf. ‘And I wonder many other things. Good-bye now! Take care
            of yourself! Look out for me, especially
            at unlikely times! Good-bye!’
            </p>
         
         <p>
            <a id="page54"></a>Frodo saw her to the door. She gave a final wave of her hand, and walked off at a
            surprising pace; but Frodo thought the old
            wizard looked unusually bent, almost as if she was carrying a great weight. The evening
            was closing in, and her cloaked figure
            quickly vanished into the twilight. Frodo did not see her again for a long time.
